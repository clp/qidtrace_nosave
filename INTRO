qidtrace_nosave

A project to learn some techniques of Perl coding, based on
searching a log file for specific data.

My first solution to this problem is described in another
project - see this repository at github:
  https://github.com/clp/sendmail_trace

My second solution to this problem is described in another
project - see this repository at github:
  https://github.com/clp/qidtrace

Some files from the qidtrace project were copied to qidtrace2
on Tue2011_1011_22:26, then modified from that point.

My third solution to this problem was renamed
from qidtrace2 to qidtrace_nosave.
The files from qidtrace2 were copied here on Thu2011_1013, 
to the qidtrace_nosave project, which will be continued.
qidtrace2 will be abandoned.

The original files for qidtrace were built by Jeff M., and
provided on 2011_0727.

My task is to write the missing code inside this framework.

The main files holding the code for this project are:
  bin/qidtrace
  lib/Sendmail/QidTrace.pm
