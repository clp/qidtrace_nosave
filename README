qidtrace_nosave  version 0.02
===============================

qidtrace is a filter for sendmail log files.
It follows sendmail's queue id strings so that sequences of log
lines can be found.

The program reads the input sendmail log file in one pass.

It does not save the o/p data and print it after all groups
of matching lines have been found.
It prints each group of matching lines when they are found,
then continues to look for more groups of matching lines
until finished with the i/p file.

The input data file is maillog.mx.
The initial release provides an abbreviated 9999-line input file.

Execute the tests using prove (specify the local lib dir
if the module is not installed in the @INC path):
  prove -I lib -vr t

The initial version comprises a framework, and the core methods
are not included.  They are to be written as an exercise for the
student.



Version 0.01, Tue2011_1011_22:33 

Some files in the qidtrace2 project dir were copied from the qidtrace
project earlier today, including test code and data files.

Then the two main code files were replaced with the original files
from the project code by Jeff M, and the initial commit to the
git repository was made:
  bin/qidtrace
  lib/Sendmail/QidTrace.pm

New development will start from this point, and will draw on code
from the previous project, called qidtrace.


Version 0.02, Thu2011_1013_13:51 

The files in the qidtrace2 project dir were copied to the
qidtrace_nosave project dir, including test code and data files.
New code will be built in qidtrace_nosave, and qidtrace2 will be
abandoned.
