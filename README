qidtrace  version 0.01
===============================

qidtrace is a filter for sendmail log files.
It follows sendmails queue id strings so that sequences of log
lines can be found.

The program reads the input sendmail log file in one pass.

The input data file is maillog.mx.
The initial release provides an abbreviated 9999-line input file.

Execute the tests using prove (specify the local lib dir
if the module is not installed in the @INC path):
  prove -I lib -vr t

The initial version comprises a framework, and the core methods
are not included.  They are to be written as an exercise for the
student.



Version 0.01, Tue2011_1011_22:33 

Some files in the qidtrace2 project dir were copied from the qidtrace
project earlier today, including test code and data files.

Then the two main code files were replaced with the original files
from the project code by Jeff M, and the initial commit to the
git repository was made:
  bin/qidtrace
  lib/Sendmail/QidTrace.pm
